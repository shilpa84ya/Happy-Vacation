        <p >The Land of High Passes, Ladakh, the newly created <b style="color: blue;">Union Territory</b> in India (previously a part of Jammu & Kashmir), boasts a landscape that can leave you with your jaws dropped.
             It is a place where the landscape changes dramatically; it is truly astonishing to see the mountains, snow, cold desert, alpine meadows and lakes at a short distance from each other. 
            Tourism in Ladakh is an absolute delight for nature lovers as well as adventurers.</p>
           <br>
            Adorned with the lofty barren mountains, Ladakh is home to some of the highest motorable passes like Khardung 
            La (5359 m), Marsimik La (5582 m), and Chang La (5360 m), and alpine lakes like Pangong Tso (4350 m) and Tso Moriri
             (4522 m). Ladakh is further divided into three regions - Leh, Nubra, and Zanskar, and each region has several places to see.
            Ladakh is majorly popular amongst the adventurers who feel welcomed by the number of adrenaline rushing activities offered here.</p>
    
            
            <br>
            The union territory is amongst the top trekking destinations in India with amazing and unmatched treks like the popular Frozen River Trek/Chadar Trek.
             Ladakh also has opportunities for mountaineering, motor biking, mountain biking, white water rafting and more.</p>
        <p>Explore the mesmerizing beauty of Leh Ladakh and immerse yourself in its rich culture.</p>

                <h4>Summer Season in Ladhakh</h4>
                <p>
                    The summer season is between April 
                    and June in Ladakh, when the
                    temperature ranges between 5°C 
                and 25°C. The month of May marks
                 the beginning of tourist season 
                 in Ladakh  
                </p>

                    <h4>Mansoon Season in Ladakh</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since Ladakh falls in a high-
                        altitude region, it receives no to
                        very little rain between July and
                         September. This is the best time
                          to visit Ladakh

                    <h4>Winter Season in Ladakh</h4>
                    <p>
                        Winter season is from October
                        to February in Ladakh. The 
                        entire region receives heavy
                        snowfall which sometimes leads
                         to the blocking of roads.
                          Nonetheless, Ladakh is accessible
                           during winter via flights.
