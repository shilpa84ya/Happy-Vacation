              left behind as a tell-tale sign of her presence, coffee plantations on steep slopes, falling and flowing
               Cauvery River from a distant place refreshing and nurturing the flora and fauna and its harsh yet 
        soothing noise, a golden yellow-orange ritually spread on the sheet of morning sky acting as backdrop to the 
        contrasting green-brown small-big peaks,
         and many such vivid sceneries of Nature are a constant companion of those choosing to travel Coorg.</p>
